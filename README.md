Documentation
Getting started
This page contains important information on how to properly configure Payment API 

This Application is implemented using .Net6, a clean architecture, also known as the Clean Architecture or Onion Architecture, is a software architectural style that encourages separation of concerns and maintainability by dividing the program into discrete layers, each with a defined duty. The Presentation Layer, Application Layer, Domain Layer, and Infrastructure Layer are common examples of these layers. Here's a rundown on how to build a clean architecture in.NET 6:

The Presentation Layer is in charge of all user interaction and user interface concerns. This might be a web application (ASP.NET Core), a desktop application, or a mobile app in.NET 6.

Application Layer: Also known as use cases or application services, the application layer houses business logic that is particular to a certain application. It serves as a bridge between the Presentation and Domain Layers. This layer is in charge of coordinating operations and ensuring that business logic is appropriately applied.
